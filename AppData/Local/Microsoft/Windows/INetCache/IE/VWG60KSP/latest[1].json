settings, we've adjusted the left navigation to group the utilities. As the number of utilities shipped with PowerToys keeps growing, we felt this was a needed adjustment. Thanks everyone for your feedback!\r\n - Workspaces received many bug fixes, including the proper launching of many instances of the same application in the same workspace. Note, we are still actively looking at how to properly handle PWA detection.\r\n - We've added a telemetry opt-in option in the Settings General tab. As it is off-by-default, we encourage users to turn it on as that helps direct our development efforts and their journeys. More information about the data we collect can be found in the [PowerToys Data and Privacy documentation](https://aka.ms/powertoys-data-and-privacy-documentation) and what each event does.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n - Added a setting for telemetry opt-in (off by default, however, see above for why we encourage you to opt-in!) and user controls to view data.\r\n - Improved exception logging by adding the type of Exception and InnerException. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n\r\n### Advanced Paste\r\n\r\n - Added new built-in actions: Image to text, and paste txt, png or html as a file.\r\n\r\n### Mouse Jump\r\n\r\n - Refactored the common classes into a separate project.

Thanks [@mikeclayton](https://github.com/mikeclayton)!\r\n\r\n### New+\r\n\r\n - Fixed the telemetry event for when the modules is enabled or disabled.

Thanks [@PesBandi](https://github.com/PesBandi)!\r\n - Improved error handling when copying to the clipboard results in an error.

Thanks [@Sirozha1337](https://github.com/Sirozha1337)!\r\n\r\n### Registry Preview\r\n\r\n - Adopted the Monaco Editor as the UI text editor. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n\r\n### Settings\r\n\r\n - Fixed a crash when trying to access a non-existing templates folder from the New+ page. (This was a hotfix for 0.85)\r\n - Added a navigation tree to group utilities in the left navigation menu.\r\n - Sorted the list of languages in the language selection combo box in the General tab. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n - Fixed the state of the info bar about templates not being backed up to not close and react to the module's enabled state in the New+ page. Thanks [@htcfreek](https://github.com/htcfreek)!\r\n - Fixed a crash caused by a dangling thread.\r\n - Clicking a notification about there being an update available should now correctly open the Settings application in the General tab.\r\n - Fixed a UI freeze when trying to access the Diagnostic Data Viewer files. Thanks [@davidegiacometti](https://github.com/davidegiacometti)!\r\n\r\n### Workspaces\r\n\r\n - Fixed launching the incorrect workspace when launching many workspaces quickly through shortcuts.

Thanks [@Aaron-Junker](https://github.com/Aaron-Junker)!\r\n - Updated System.Text.Json to 8.0.5 and System.Runtime.Caching to 8.0.1 and related dependencies to the latest to address security reports. Thanks [@snickler](https://github.com/snickler)!\r\n - Updated WinAppSDK to 1.6.1 and CsWinRT to 2.1.5.
