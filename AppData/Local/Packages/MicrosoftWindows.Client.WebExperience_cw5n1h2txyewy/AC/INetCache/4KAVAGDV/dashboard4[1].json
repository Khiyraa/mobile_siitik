Things You MUST Do If You’re Planning to Downsize Your Home","abstract":"Consider this your pre-moving checklist. Whether your kids have recently moved out for college or you're simply swimming in unused space, a too-big home can feel much more like a burden than a boon. Moving into a smaller space, aka downsizing, is a great way to reduce clutter, save money, and minimize the maintenance and upkeep of your house. Though living in a small home can present unique design challenges if you're used to living with a lot of space, it can help you reorganize your priorities in your current stage of life so you're only holding onto what matters most. Downsizing doesn't happen overnight, and starting the process can be a considerable, all-hands-on-deck undertaking. If you're planning to move from a large, multilevel space into a tiny home, for example, you'll have a lot of planning and sorting to take on. There are several important considerations to remember as you plan your move to a new home and begin paring down your possessions. Before you set the wheels in motion, check out these 9 best tips for downsizing your home to make your journey as smooth as possible.
